# encipherMach
NOTES: 
Program now handles spaces, but must be rerun after each newline is entered. Up to 10,098 characters may be entered at once. Spaces  are replaced by X. (That is how spaces were entered on the Enigma.)

Double-click the engima.exe file to run on Windows. "enigma.c" is the C code file. "enigma" is the Linux executable. On Linux, you may have to run "chmod +x enigma" in the folder where the file is in order to have executing permissions for the file. 

"cTest.c", "cTest", and "cTest.exe" are the C code file and the Linux and Windows executables, respectively, for a bare-bones Engima machine without switchable rotors or a plugboard. 

Input, output, and key settings are stored in files called input.txt, output.txt, and key_settings.txt. 
Program requires r1, r2, r3, etc. to run. DO NOT delete those files.
