NOTES: 
Program now handles spaces, but must be rerun after each newline is entered. Up to 10,098 characters may be entered at once. Spaces  are replaced by X. (That is how spaces were entered on the Enigma.)

Double-click the .exe file to run on Windows. cTest.c is the C code file. cTest is the Linux executable. On Linux, you may have to run chmod +x cTest in the folder where the file is in order to have executing permissions for the file. 

Input, output, and key settings are stored in files called input.txt, output.txt, and key_settings.txt. 
Program requires r1, r2, r3, etc. to run. DO NOT delete those files. 

The Windows .exe is not up-to-date. It works, but it does not include a plugboard.
